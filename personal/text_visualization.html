  <h2>text visualizations</h2><br>

  <p>these visualizations were inspired by the <a class="resumeLink" href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/art/">work</a> of martin krzynski and christian vasile who visualized the sequences of the digits after the decimal in pi. i decided it would be interesting to visualize the sequence of letters in text in a similar fashion. each segment around the circle represents a letter of the alphabet and each line represents a transition between subsequent letters. they were made using circos and python.</p><br>

   <br><p>there seems to be a culturally imposed divide of skills that people can have: if you’re good at reading/writing then you’re probably not good at math; if you’re good at math then you’re probably not good at reading/writing. most of the focus is centered on improving the way we teach people math/programming and making technology more accessible to them as its use becomes more prevalent in the world. i was lucky that math always clicked for me in school and i enjoyed it enough to study it at university. however, knowing that i liked math imposed an inherent lack of ability to write - i was terrified of english and lit classes. it was strange for me though, because i loved to read. i didn’t really understand this disconnect fully until i reflected on this project. i made this visualization in pure curiosity; i didn’t really have a clear intention of why i was doing it at the time. after thinking more about it, i realized it was my attempt to make writing more math-y. this was the only way i could be comfortable with it. i hope to make further projects that try to make language more math-y, to help people like me and also other engineers for whom writing a paper was freaking huge deal in university.</p>
