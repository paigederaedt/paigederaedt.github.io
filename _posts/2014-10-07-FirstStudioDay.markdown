Today was considered our first studio day. Taeyoon started the day with a check in and went over all the events that SFPC will be participating in this term. All seem really awesome. He encourages us to present at some but not all of them, and I know I'll have to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to do this. I spent some time looking at the generative design book which has a bunch of processing tutorials - I focused on the text section and worked through some fun stuff.

I asked Jonas what he was working on and he showed me this tool he made that visualized what servers your computer was pinging all over the world. He got it working in a day with node.js and d3 which is pretty amazing. Zan showed me a few things she's done in d3 and introduced me to the examples page and [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org) which had some chord diagrams very similar to my circos visualization. I'm going to try to use it to animate my circos visualization. Overall, I felt pretty overwhelmed/anxious today. I was introduced to a lot of new information and tools and got a chance to see what others were working on. Everyone is working on interesting mini projects and I want to be able to create something cool too. 

Over lunch, Lauren mentioned a workshop for women in tech that she went to that focused the first half enirely on understanding [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and that totally clicked with me because I feel like that's what happening to me here at SFPC, but I know I need to change that fast. I spent the rest of today thinking about the themes, my ideas, and generating new inspirations. Looking forward to see what happens!
